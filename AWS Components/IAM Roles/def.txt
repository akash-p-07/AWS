IAM

- Identity Access Management
- Root account created by default, shouldn't be used/shared.
- Best practise is to use a IAM role even for administartor and the root account.
- Users are people within the organization which can be grouped.
- Groups only contain users and not other groups.
- It's not compulsaroy for users to belong to a group.
- Users can belong to multiple groups.

>>IAM Permissions
- Users or groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies.
- These policies help us define permissions of users.

>>IAM Policies
- IAM consists of *version, *ID.
- IAM statement consist of -> Sid, Effect, Principal, Action, Resources, Condition.

>>IAM Password Policy
- Strong passwrd - Higher security for your account
- You can set up custom passwrd Policy
- Allow IAM users to chnage their own password
- Req users to change their password after sometime
- Prevent password re-use

>>Multi Factor Authentication - MFA
- If password is stolen or hacked, account is not compromised
- MFA device options
  1. Virtual MFA devices  
  2. Universal 2nd Factor Security Key
  3. Hardware key for MFA device
  4. Hardware Key For MFA Device for AWS Gov cloud(US)

>> How to access AWS?
   1. AWS Management Console(protected by psswrd + MFA)
   2. AWS Command Line Interface(CLI): Protected by Access Keys
   3. AWS Software Development Kit (SDK)

>> IAM Roles for Services
- Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf
- To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles.
- IAM role will be just like a user, but they are intended to be used not by physical people but instead by AWS services.
- Common Roles:
        1. EC2 Instance
        2. Lambda function Roles
        3. Roles for ClouFormation

>> IAM Security Tools
- IAM credentials report (account-level)
  A reprot that lists all your account's users & the status of their various credentials.
- IAM Access Advisor (user-level)

>> IAM Guidelines & Best Practices
- Don't use the root account execept for AWS account setup
- One physical user = One AWS user
- Assign users to groups & assign permissions to groups
- Create a strong password Policy
- Use & enforce the use of MFA
- Create & use roles for giving permissions to AWS services
- Use Acces Keys for programmatic Access(CLI/SDK)
- Audit permissions of your account with IAM credentials report & also with IAM access analyzer
- Never share IAM users & Access Keys

- Groups: Containsusers only
- Policies: JSON document that outlines permissions for users or groups.
- Roles: For EC2 instances or AWS services
- Security: MFA + PAssword Policy
- Access Keys: access AWS using the CLI or SDK
- Audit: IAM credentials report & IAM Access Advisor
